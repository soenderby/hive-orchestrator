# Ideas

This document captures future ideas and potential features worth revisiting. It is intentionally lightweight and append-only.

- **Decision log / lessons learned feature**
  - Add a lightweight mechanism to capture decisions, lessons learned, and discarded ideas so that project history isn’t lost.
  - Potential implementation: append-only markdown log in `docs/` or `.hive/`, with a simple CLI helper (e.g., `hive log`).
  - Scope should remain minimal: no enforcement, just easy capture and discoverability.
